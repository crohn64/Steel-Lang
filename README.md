# Steel Lang
## _Readable,Portable,Usuable_



Steel Lang is a high level programing language focused on
Readability, Portability, and most importantly Usuability
Here is some uses for it:

- Web Apps
- Cross Platform Programs
- Server Management
- System Programming
- Operating Systems
## Features

- Easy to use IO Modules
- Cross platform
- Highly Customizable
- Easy to read(just like english)
- Easy support for modules

Steel tries to imitate java's write once, run everywhere. Its syntax
is not functional like modern programming languages, but it does use the
readability we had with BASIC.


## Syntax Example

As of current moment, there is no build!
But a windows, linux, and mac installer will be made soon. 
This is what the syntax and code will look like when it is finished:

Hello World

```sh
section main
print "hello world"
end
```
If Statement

```sh
section main

set n1 to 3
set n2 to 2
set n3 to n1 + n2

if n3 == 5
 do print "True"
 else print "False"

end
```

Readme Will be finished too soon.
